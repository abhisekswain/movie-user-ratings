# Quantifying audience likes and dislikes of movies

**Can we predict the audience reception for a movie based on certain factors?**  

This is the question I set out to answer for my second project of Metis. I have always been a fan of low-budget, off-the-beat cinema and my choices incline more towards films that are thought provoking and original than big-budget action films or franchise dramas. Thus, using imdb user ratings as my dependent variable, I wanted to analyze factors that make audiences like or give high ratings to films.
